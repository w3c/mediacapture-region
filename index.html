      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This document introduces an API for cropping a video track derived from display-capture of
        the current tab.

      This First Public Working Draft represents the direction the Web Real-Time Communications
      Working Group intends to explore to solve the use case of partial capture of browsing
      contexts. The Working Group is particularly interested in feedback on how well this direction
      matches the said use case from potential adopters of the API.

      <section id="generic-use-case">
        <h3>Generic Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          Complex applications often comprise multiple [=documents=] in distinct [=iframes=], all
          displayed within the same [=browsing context=]. Consider such an application. Assume one
          of these documents, <var>CAPTURING-DOC</var> uses {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} or
          <code>getViewportMedia</code> to capture the entire current [=browsing context=]. If this
          document then wishes to crop the video track to the coordinates of some sub-section
          <var>CAPTURE-TARGET</var> of a collaborating document <var>CAPTURED-DOC</var>, how can
          <var>CAPTURING-DOC</var> do so performantly and reliably? Recall especially that changes
          in layout due to scrolling, zooming or window resizing present additional challenges.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="practical-use-case">
        <h3>Practical Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a combo-application consisting of two major parts hosted in different iframes
          within the same tab - a video-conferencing application and a productivity-suite
          application. Assume the video-conferencing uses existing/upcoming APIs such as
          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and/or <code>getViewportMedia</code> and captures the
          entire tab. Now it needs to crop away everything other than a particular section of the
          productivity-suite. It needs to crop away its own video-conferencing content, any speaker
          notes and other private and/or irrelevant content in the productivity-suite, before
          transmitting the resulting cropped video remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, consider that it is likely that the two collaborating applications are
          cross-origin from each other. They can post messages, but all communication is
          asynchronous, and it's easier and more performant if information is transmitted sparingly
          between them. That precludes solutions involving posting of entire frames, as well as
          solutions which are too slow to react to changes in layout (e.g. scrolling, zooming and
          window-size changes).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worthwhile to note that most applications would likey prefer to use
          <code>getViewportMedia</code> in such scenarios. However, as of this writing,
          <code>getViewportMedia</code> is still unspecified and unimplemented. It will have
          non-trivial requirements whose adoption will take some time and effort. As such, many
          applications will likely use a combination of {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and
          Region Capture for some time to come.

      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>The region-capture mechanism comprises two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          [=CropTarget production=]: A mechanism for <dfn>tagging</dfn> an {{Element}} as a
          potential target for the [=cropping mechanism=].
        </li>
        <li>
          [=Cropping mechanism=]: A mechanism for instructing the user agent to start cropping a
          video track to the contours of a previously [=tagging|tagged=] {{Element}}, or to stop
          such cropping and revert a track to its [=uncropped=] state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We define two <dfn>crop-states</dfn> for video tracks - <dfn>cropped</dfn> and
        <dfn>uncropped</dfn>. Tracks start out [=uncropped=], and may turn to [=cropped=] when
        {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} is successfully called on them.

        <p>
          The [=cropping mechanism=] presented in this document
          ({{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}}) relies on [=Crop-session Target=] rather than
          on direct node references. This serves a dual purpose.

          <li>
            <p>
              [=Tagging=] an {{Element}} as a potential crop-target allows the user agent to avoid
              unnecessary work on all other elements, like the calculation of bounding boxes and
              sending such coordinates cross-process.

              Calling {{CropTarget/fromElement}} with an {{Element}} of a supported type associates

        <h3>BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack</h3>
        <p>
          Recall that, as per [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]], when {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called,
          it returns a {{Promise}}&lt;{{MediaStream}}&gt;, and that this {{MediaStream}} contains
          exactly one video track, whose type is {{MediaStreamTrack}}.
        </p>
        <p>
          We specify that if the user chooses to capture a [=browser=] [=display-surface=], the user
          agent MUST instantiate the video track as either {{MediaStreamTrack}}, or as some
          sub-class of {{MediaStreamTrack}}, and that {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} MUST
          be exposed on this track. For simplicity's sake, this document assumes that a subclass
          called {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack}} is used by the user agent.
        </p>
        <p>The track MUST be initially [=uncropped=].</p>
        <pre class="idl">
          [Exposed = Window]
          interface BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack : MediaStreamTrack {
            Promise&lt;undefined&gt; cropTo(CropTarget? cropTarget);
            BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack clone();
          };

          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Calls to this method instruct the user agent to start/stop cropping a video track to
              the
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-element-getboundingclientrect">
                bounding client rectangle</a
              >
              of <var>cropTarget</var>.{{CropTarget/[[Element]]}}. Since the track is restricted to
              the visible viewport of the [=display-surface=], the captured area will be the
              intersection of the visible viewport and the element bounding client rectangle.
              Whenever {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} is invoked, the user agent MUST
              execute the following algorithm:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>

                  If <var>cropTarget</var> is neither a [=valid CropTarget=] nor <code>null</code>,
                  the user agent MUST return a {{Promise}} [=rejected=] with an {{UnknownError}}.

              </li>
              <li>Let <var>p</var> be a new {{Promise}}.</li>

                    If the user agent is unable to change the [=crop-state=] of the
                    {{MediaStreamTrack}}, for example due to resource limitation, the user agent MUST
                    return a new {{Promise}}, [=rejected=] with an {{OperationError}}.

                  <li>

                      the user agent MUST update [=this=] video track's [=crop-state=] according to
                      <var>cropTarget</var>:

                        cropping. [=This=] video track reverts to the [=uncropped=] state.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If <var>cropTarget</var> is a [=valid CropTarget=], the user agent MUST
                        start cropping [=this=] video track to the contours of the element
                        referenced by this {{CropTarget}}. This means that for each new frame
                        produced on the track, the user agent calculates the bounding box of the
                        pixels belonging to the element, and crops the frame to the coordinates of
                        this bounding box.

                      uncropped) according to <var>PRE-STATE</var> will be delivered to the
                      application, and that any additional frames delivered to the application will
                      therefore be cropped (or uncropped) according to either
                      <var>POST-STATE</var> or a later state.

            box of all pixels belonging to the [=crop-session target=]. This intersection is defined
            as the crop-session target's coordinates for that frame.

              We define as an <dfn>empty crop-session target</dfn> the case where a [=crop-session
              target=] is attached to the DOM, yet consists of zero pixels which are drawn inside of
              the [=top-level browsing context|top-level browsing context's=] viewport.

                <li>The [=crop-session target=] consists of zero pixels.</li>
                <li>
                  The [=browsing context|browsing context's=] viewport has been scrolled and the

              The user agent MUST NOT produce new frames on tracks with an [=empty crop-session
              target=]. For such a track, the user agent MUST resume the production of frames if the
              track either become [=uncropped=], or if its [=crop-session target=] stops being
              [=empty crop-session target|empty=].

            <h5>Disconnected Crop-Session Target</h5>
            <p>
              We define as <dfn>disconnected crop-session target</dfn> a [=crop-session target=]
              that had been detached from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              The difference between an [=empty crop-session target=] and a [=disconnected
              crop-session target=], is that a [=disconnected crop-session target|disconnected=] one
              may become
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management#mark-and-sweep_algorithm"
                >unreachable</a
              >, in which case it would not produce any new frames. Nevertheless, the user agent
              MUST treat a [=disconnected crop-session target=] the same way it treats an [=empty
              crop-session target=]. The application may call
              {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} on the track with either {{undefined}} or a
              new {{CropTarget}}, thereby allowing the production of frames on the track to be
              resumed.
