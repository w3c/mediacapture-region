      <p>
        This document introduces an API for cropping a video track derived from display-capture of
        the current [=browsing context=].

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the definition of the following concepts from [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]]:
        <dfn>display-surface</dfn> and <dfn>browser</dfn> [=display-surface=].
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall that when {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called and the user chooses to share
        some [=display-surface=], exactly one video track is produced. If the user chooses to
        capture a [=browser=] [=display-surface=] associated with the [=browsing context=] from
        which {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} was called, we define the resulting capture session
        as <dfn>self-capture</dfn>, and this video track a <dfn>self-capture video track</dfn>.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <section id="generic-use-case">
        <h3>Generic Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          Complex applications often comprise multiple [=documents=] in distinct [=iframes=], all
          displayed within the same [=browsing context=]. Consider such an application. Assume one
          of these documents, <var>CAPTURING-DOC</var> uses {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} or
          <code>getViewportMedia</code> to capture the entire current [=browsing context=]. If this
          document then wishes to crop the video track to the coordinates of some sub-section
          <var>CAPTURE-TARGET</var> of a collaborating document <var>CAPTURED-DOC</var>, how can
          <var>CAPTURING-DOC</var> do so performantly and reliably? Recall especially that changes
          in layout due to scrolling, zooming or window resizing present additional challenges.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="practical-use-case">
        <h3>Practical Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a combo-application consisting of two major parts - a video-conferencing
          application and a productivity-suite application co-existing in a [=browsing context=].
          Assume the video-conferencing uses existing/upcoming APIs such as
          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and/or <code>getViewportMedia</code> and captures the
          entire [=browsing context=]. Now it needs to crop away everything other than a particular
          section of the productivity-suite. It needs to crop away its own video-conferencing
          content, any speaker notes and other private and/or irrelevant content in the
          productivity-suite, before transmitting the resulting cropped video remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, consider that it is likely that the two collaborating applications are
          cross-origin from each other. They can post messages, but all communication is
          asynchronous, and it's easier and more performant if information is transmitted sparingly
          between them. That precludes solutions involving posting of entire frames, as well as
          solutions which are too slow to react to changes in layout (e.g. scrolling, zooming and
          window-size changes).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worthwhile to note that most applications would likey prefer to use
          <code>getViewportMedia</code> in such scenarios. However, as of this writing,
          <code>getViewportMedia</code> is still unspecified and unimplemented. It will have
          non-trivial requirements whose adoption will take some time and effort. As such, many
          applications will likely use a combination of {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and
          Region Capture for some time to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and Region Capture is also useful
          for applications that allow the users to choose whichever [=display-surface=] they wish,
          but offer distinct functionality depending on whether users choose to [=self-capture=] or,
          conversely, choose to capture a window or monitor. Such applications would only succeed in
          using Region Capture if the user chose to [=self-capture=]; otherwise, the attempt to
          apply cropping would be a no-op.

    <section id="scope">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        As presently defined, {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}}(<var>ID</var>) returns a
        [=rejected=] {{Promise}} if the <var>ID</var> is not associated with an {{HTMLElement}}
        within the current [=browsing context=]. That means that all of the mechanisms introduced by
        this document are only relevant for [=self-capture=]. An immediate corollary is that, since
        both the capturing as well as captured documents live within the same [=browsing context=],
        navigation of their (shared) top-level document would break off the capture, and therefore
        also the cropping session.

      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>The region-capture mechanism comprises two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          [=CropTarget production=]: A mechanism for <dfn>tagging</dfn> an {{HTMLElement}} as a
          potential target for the [=cropping mechanism=].
        </li>
        <li>
          [=Cropping mechanism=]: A mechanism for instructing the user agent to start cropping a
          video track to the contours of a previously [=tagging|tagged=] {{HTMLElement}}, or to stop
          such cropping and revert a track to its [=uncropped=] state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We define two <dfn>crop-states</dfn> for video tracks - <dfn>cropped</dfn> and
        <dfn>uncropped</dfn>. Tracks start out [=uncropped=], and may turn to [=cropped=] when
        {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} is successfully called on them.

        <h3>CropTarget Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          The [=cropping mechanism=] presented in this document
          ({{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}}) relies on [=Crop-session Target=] rather than
          on direct node references. This serves a dual purpose.

          <li>
            <p>
              [=Tagging=] an {{HTMLElement}} as a potential crop-target allows the user agent to
              avoid unnecessary work on all other elements, like the calculation of bounding boxes
              and sending such coordinates cross-process.

        <p>
          Recall that, as per [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]], when {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called,
          it returns a {{Promise}}&lt;{{MediaStream}}&gt;, and that this {{MediaStream}} contains
          exactly one video track, whose type is {{MediaStreamTrack}}.
        </p>
        <p>
          We specify that if the user chooses to capture a [=browser=] [=display-surface=], the user
          agent MUST instantiate the video track as either {{MediaStreamTrack}}, or as some
          sub-class of {{MediaStreamTrack}}, and that {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} MUST
          be exposed on this track. For simplicity's sake, this document assumes that a subclass
          called {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack}} is used by the user agent.
        </p>
        <p>The track MUST be initially [=uncropped=].</p>

                        produced on the track, the user agent calculates the bounding box of the
                        pixels belonging to the element, and crops the frame to the coordinates of
                        this bounding box.

                          MediaStreamTrack transforms</a
                        >. It is expected that the first newly cropped video frame will be enqueued
                        on the MediaStreamTrack ReadableStream just after the cropTo promise is
                        resolved.

              When a {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack}} is cloned, the user agent MUST produce a
              track which is initially [=uncropped=], regardless of the [=crop-state=] of the
              original track.

            We define an {{HTMLElement}} for which a {{CropTarget}} was produced (through a call to

            Consider a frame produced on a [=cropped=] video track. The user agent calculates the
            intersection of (i) the [=browsing context=]'s viewport and (ii) the bounding box of all
            pixels belonging to the [=crop-session target=]. This intersection is defined as the
            crop-session target's coordinates for that frame.

            <p>
              We define as an <dfn>empty crop-session target</dfn> the case where a [=crop-session
              target=] is attached to the DOM, yet consists of zero pixels which are drawn inside of
              the [=browsing context|browsing context's=] viewport.

                <li>The [=crop-session target=] consists of zero pixels.</li>
                <li>
                  The [=browsing context|browsing context's=] viewport has been scrolled and the
                  [=crop-session target=] now lies outside of the viewport.

              The user agent MUST NOT produce new frames on tracks with an [=empty crop-session
              target=]. For such a track, the user agent MUST resume the production of frames if the
              track either become [=uncropped=], or if its [=crop-session target=] stops being
              [=empty crop-session target|empty=].

            <p>
              We define as <dfn>disconnected crop-session target</dfn> a [=crop-session target=]
              that had been detached from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              The difference between an [=empty crop-session target=] and a [=disconnected
              crop-session target=], is that a [=disconnected crop-session target|disconnected=] one
              may become

                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management#mark-and-sweep_algorithm"
                >unreachable</a
              >, in which case it would not produce any new frames. Nevertheless, the user agent
              MUST treat a [=disconnected crop-session target=] the same way it treats an [=empty
              crop-session target=]. The application may call
              {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo}} on the track with either {{undefined}} or a
              new {{CropTarget}}, thereby allowing the production of frames on the track to be
              resumed.
